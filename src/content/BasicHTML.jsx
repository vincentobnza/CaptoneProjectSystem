          HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure
          a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured
          within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images
          and data tables. As the title suggests, this article will give you a
          basic understanding of HTML and its functions.

      <Title>So what is HTML?</Title>
      <Description>
        HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content.
        HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or
        wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or
        act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink
        to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or
        smaller, and so on. For example, take the following line of content:
      </Description>
      <Example text="My cat is very grumpy"></Example>
      <Description>
        If we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a
        paragraph by enclosing it in paragraph tags:
      </Description>
      <Code code="<p>My cat is very grumpy</p>" language="htmlbars"></Code>
      <Title>Anatomy of an HTML element</Title>
      <Description>
        Let's explore this paragraph element a bit further.
      </Description>
      <Image
        image="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics/grumpy-cat-small.png"
        height={280}
      />
      <List
        title="The main parts of our element are as follows"
        items={[
          "The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect ‚Äî in this case where the paragraph begins.",
          "The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends ‚Äî in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.",
          "The content: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.",
          "The element: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.",
        ]}
      />
      <Description>
        Elements can also have attributes that look like the following:
      </Description>
      <Image image="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics/grumpy-cat-attribute-small.png" />
      <Description>
        Attributes contain extra information about the element that you don't
        want to appear in the actual content. Here, class is the attribute name
        and editor-note is the attribute value. The class attribute allows you
        to give the element a non-unique identifier that can be used to target
        it (and any other elements with the same class value) with style
        information and other things. Some attributes have no value, such as
        required.
      </Description>
      <List
        title="Attributes that set a value always have:"
        items={[
          "A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute, if the element already has one or more attributes).",
          "The attribute name followed by an equal sign.",
          "The attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks.",
        ]}
      />
      <Note>

        }
      </Note>
      <Title>Nesting elements</Title>
      <Description>
        {`You can put elements inside other elements too ‚Äî this is called nesting. If we wanted to state that our cat is very grumpy, we could wrap the word "very" in a <strong> element, which means that the word is to be strongly emphasized:`}
      </Description>
      <Code code={`<p>My cat is <strong>very</strong> grumpy.</p>`} />
      <Description>
        {`You do however need to make sure that your elements are properly nested. In the example above, we opened the <p> element first, then the <strong> element; therefore, we have to close the <strong> element first, then the <p> element. The following is incorrect:`}
      </Description>
      <Code
        code={`<p>My cat is <strong>very grumpy.</p></strong>`}
        error={!error}
      />
      <Description>
        The elements have to open and close correctly so that they are clearly
        inside or outside one another. If they overlap as shown above, then your
        web browser will try to make the best guess at what you were trying to
        say, which can lead to unexpected results. So don't do it!

        A lot of the web's content is lists and HTML has special elements for

        common list types are ordered and unordered lists:
      </Description>
      <List
        items={[
          `Unordered lists are for lists where the order of the items doesn't matter, such as a shopping list. These are wrapped in a <ul> element.`,
          `Ordered lists are for lists where the order of the items does matter, such as a recipe. These are wrapped in an <ol> element.`,

        As we said before, it embeds an image into our page in the position it

        path to our image file.
      </Description>
      <Description>
        We have also included an alt (alternative) attribute. In the alt
        attribute, you specify descriptive text for users who cannot see the
        image, possibly because of the following reasons:
      </Description>
      <List
        items={[
          "They are visually impaired. Users with significant visual impairments often use tools called screen readers to read out the alt text to them.",
          "Something has gone wrong causing the image not to display. For example, try deliberately changing the path inside your src attribute to make it incorrect. If you save and reload the page, you should see something like this in place of the image:",
        ]}
      />
      <Description>
        The keywords for alt text are "descriptive text". The alt text you write
        should provide the reader with enough information to have a good idea of
        what the image conveys. In this example, our current text of "My test
        image" is no good at all. A much better alternative for our Firefox logo
        would be "The Firefox logo: a flaming fox surrounding the Earth."
